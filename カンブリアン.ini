今年のカンブリアンは去年のＡＩカンブリアン・早稲田2023のコメントを読み込んで、
よく観察して
今期のこの早稲田カンブリアン2024を意識して望みました。
リーフをつなげて樹を育てるように
樹から樹への１年毎のメタ・カンブリアンがいよいよ動きだし
どんな樹になるのか、刮目します。
この先を楽しみにしています。

"Imitate the style of Diane Arbus using a pinhole camera to capture the following scenes:

A solemn figure standing alone in a dimly lit room, with a faint light shining from a small window.
A pregnant woman sitting on a simple wooden chair, her face turned slightly away from the camera, her expression inscrutable.
A newborn baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a humble manger, surrounded by soft, diffused light.
A young woman holding the baby, her eyes cast downward, as if contemplating the miracle before her."

"Please create a series of scenes resembling photographs taken by Joel-Peter Witkin with a pinhole camera:

A somber figure stands alone in a dimly lit room, cast in eerie shadows, with only a faint glimmer of light filtering through a small window.
A pregnant woman sits on a weathered wooden chair, her face partially obscured, her expression enigmatic and haunting.
A newborn baby lies swaddled in rough cloth within a crude wooden cradle, surrounded by an atmosphere of mystery and solemnity.
A young woman cradles the baby in her arms, her gaze fixed on the infant with a mixture of awe and apprehension, while the dim light plays eerily across their faces."


"I longed for eternal life, forgetting to wish to stay young. Thus, I lived on for eternity, but withering so profoundly that my friends eventually packed me into a sack and hung me on the wall. Like a grotesque creation of Joel-Peter Witkin, my tattered skin and frail bones continue to murmur from the bag nailed to the wall."
