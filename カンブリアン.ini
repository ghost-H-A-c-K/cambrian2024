"Imitate the style of Diane Arbus using a pinhole camera to capture the following scenes:

A solemn figure standing alone in a dimly lit room, with a faint light shining from a small window.
A pregnant woman sitting on a simple wooden chair, her face turned slightly away from the camera, her expression inscrutable.
A newborn baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a humble manger, surrounded by soft, diffused light.
A young woman holding the baby, her eyes cast downward, as if contemplating the miracle before her."

"Please create a series of scenes resembling photographs taken by Joel-Peter Witkin with a pinhole camera:

A somber figure stands alone in a dimly lit room, cast in eerie shadows, with only a faint glimmer of light filtering through a small window.
A pregnant woman sits on a weathered wooden chair, her face partially obscured, her expression enigmatic and haunting.
A newborn baby lies swaddled in rough cloth within a crude wooden cradle, surrounded by an atmosphere of mystery and solemnity.
A young woman cradles the baby in her arms, her gaze fixed on the infant with a mixture of awe and apprehension, while the dim light plays eerily across their faces."


"I longed for eternal life, forgetting to wish to stay young. Thus, I lived on for eternity, but withering so profoundly that my friends eventually packed me into a sack and hung me on the wall. Like a grotesque creation of Joel-Peter Witkin, my tattered skin and frail bones continue to murmur from the bag nailed to the wall."

Amidst the flowers, a jug of wine,
Alone I drink with no friend near.
I raise my cup to invite the bright moon,
Making us three, my shadow makes the cheer.

Alas, the moon does not understand drinking,
And my shadow only follows my body's lead.
Brief companions, the moon and shadow,
Enjoying the moment before spring's deed.

The moon, with my song, lingers on,
My shadow, with my dance, scatters around.
Sober, we share joys together,
Drunk, each goes their own way, unbound.

May we forever share this unrequited delight,
Though far apart, under the vast celestial light.

The Dyatlov Pass incident (Russian: гибель тургруппы Дятлова, romanized: gibel turgruppy Dyatlova, lit. 'Death of the Dyatlov Tour Group') is an event in which nine Soviet hikers died in the northern Ural Mountains between February 1 and 2, 1959, under uncertain circumstances. The experienced trekking group from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, led by Igor Dyatlov, had established a camp on the eastern slopes of Kholat Syakhl in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union. Overnight, something caused them to cut their way out of their tent and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for the heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures.

"On December 5, Captain Morehouse of the Canadian ship di Grazia discovered the Mary Celeste, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean west of Lisbon, Portugal.
Captain Morehouse and Briggs are good friends and have dinner together before leaving port.
After observing the ship for about two hours, Captain Morehouse determined that it was probably adrift as it had not raised a distress signal, and sent his crew to investigate.
First mate Oliver DeVoe, who boarded the ship, reported that the whole ship was soaked.
All but one of the pumps were inoperable, the deck was flooded, and three and a half feet (about 1.1 meters) of water flooded her hold.
There was no other noticeable damage to the hull, and the ship was in navigable condition, but both the fore hatch and food storage compartment were open, the wall clock was not functioning, and the compass was destroyed.
The sextant and chronometer were missing.
The ship's only lifeboat appeared to have been forced off, or rather intentionally lowered.
There were mysterious bloodstains on three of the railings, and one had unexplained scratches.
The ship's cargo of 1,700 barrels of alcohol was unharmed when it was later unloaded in Genoa, with the exception of nine empty barrels, as well as six months' worth of food and water.
Other than the captain's logbook, no documents on board were found.
The last entry in the diary is November 24th. It said she was at sea 100 miles west of the Azores.
There was no one on board, and the 10 crew members could not be found."

There, Lu Sheng met a Taoist named Lu Weng, and told him about his own complaints about owning only a small amount of farmland. Then, the Taoist gives Lu Sheng a pillow that will make his dreams come true. When Lusei used that pillow, he quickly got promoted, got a wife, was imprisoned on a false charge, regretted seeking fame and tried to commit suicide, was lucky to escape punishment, was cleared of false charges and was given credit for his faith. He reached the peak of glory and prosperity while regaining his status, and even became king, leading to him arrogant to the honor of his wise subjects.

He was blessed with children and grandchildren and lived a happy life. However, age was not enough for him, and he died in his sleep, being missed by many people. When he suddenly woke up, the porridge he had put on the fire before going to bed had not even boiled yet. Everything was a dream and a fleeting event. Lu Sheng politely thanked Mr. Lu, who was at his bedside, and said, ``I have seen all the ups and downs of life. You paid for my desires,'' and went back to his hometown.:
